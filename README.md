# Web Stack Detector

A Firefox and Chrome extension that works out what the page you are looking at
was built with — the framework, the UI library and the bundler — and turns the
toolbar icon into that project's logo.

- A Next.js site → the Next.js mark.
- A Vue SPA on Vite → the Vue mark, with Vite in the popup.
- Built with Rspack and nothing else recognisable → the Rspack crab.
- Two rival frameworks on one page → 😈, and the popup lists everything.

Click the icon for the details: what was found, which version (as precisely as
the page allows), what evidence was absorbed, and the exact byte patterns that
led to that conclusion.

![The extension on anthropic.com: the toolbar icon has become the jQuery mark,
and the popup reads "jQuery v3.5.1 - with Rspack", listing jQuery under UI
LIBRARY and Rspack v1.3.9 under BUNDLER with a webpack 5 chip folded into it,
both with high confidence and evidence to unfold](example.png)

Not on any store — clone it and load it yourself.

## Build

Needs Node 20+. The build copies files, picks the right manifest and downscales
the toolbar icons, which is the one thing that needs a dependency (sharp).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/swwind/web-stack-detector.git
cd web-stack-detector
npm install
npm run build
```

That writes two loadable folders:

```
dist/chrome     manifest with a service-worker background
dist/firefox    manifest with an event-page background + a gecko id
```

They share every line of code and differ only in the manifest.

## Install in Chrome

1. Open `chrome://extensions`
2. Turn on **Developer mode** (top right)
3. Click **Load unpacked** and pick the `dist/chrome` folder

The icon appears straight away and survives restarts. Chrome shows a
*"Disable developer mode extensions"* warning on startup — that is the normal
nag for any unpacked extension.

Click the puzzle-piece icon and pin *Web Stack Detector* so the logo stays visible
in the toolbar, which is rather the point of it.

After changing the source, run `npm run build` again and press **reload** ↻ on
the extension's card.

## Install in Firefox

1. Open `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
2. Click **Load Temporary Add-on…**
3. Pick `dist/firefox/manifest.json` (the file, not the folder)

Then **grant site access**, or it will detect much less: Firefox MV3 makes host
permissions opt-in, so until you allow it the extension can read the page but
never the script files themselves.

- Click the puzzle-piece icon → the gear next to *Web Stack Detector* → **Always
  Allow on All Sites**
- Or `about:addons` → Web Stack Detector → **Permissions** → *Access your data for
  all websites*

**Temporary add-ons disappear when Firefox restarts.** Loading it again is the
same three steps. A permanent install would need the add-on signed by Mozilla.

## Check it works

Visit a few sites and watch the icon:

| Site | Expected |
| --- | --- |
| <https://nextjs.org> | Next.js, absorbing React + Turbopack traces |
| <https://vuejs.org> | VitePress, absorbing Vue + Vite traces |
| <https://angular.dev> | Angular 22.1.3 |
| <https://svelte.dev> | SvelteKit, absorbing Svelte 5 + Vite traces |
| <https://jquery.com> | jQuery 4.0.0 |
| <https://stackoverflow.com> | Svelte 5, with jQuery, Stimulus and webpack |

Those are the verdicts it actually produced when run against the live sites.

## What it detects

Three categories, in the order they claim the icon: a **framework** says more
about a page than the **UI library** underneath it, which says more than the
**bundler** underneath that.

## How it works

A page yields *facts*; the signature files decide what those facts mean. Nothing
in the matching engine knows what React or webpack is.

Five kinds of fact get collected:

| Fact | Where from | What it catches |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `js` | every `<script src>` and `<link rel=modulepreload>` the HTML names, fetched by the background worker | bundler runtimes, error strings, framework internals |
| `html` | the page's `<script>`, `<link>` and `<meta>` tags | generator stamps, entry-tag shapes |
| `dom` | every distinct attribute and class in the document | `ng-version`, `q:version`, `x-data`, `data-v-…`, `svelte-…` |
| `prop` | own properties of DOM nodes | `__reactFiber$…`, `__vue_app__`, `__ngContext__`, `_x_dataStack` |
| `global` | properties the page added to `window` | `webpackChunk*`, `__VUE__`, `jQuery`, `next` |

The last two need the page's own JavaScript context, which an isolated content
script cannot reach — that is what `src/content-main.js` is for.

**Page-defined globals are found by subtraction.** Rather than a list of names
worth looking for, the MAIN-world script creates a hidden same-origin
`about:blank` iframe and subtracts *its* `window` properties from the real one.
What is left is exactly what the page added, in that browser, at that version.
Any framework that puts a name on `window` is visible whether or not anyone
thought to add it to a list.

**DOM expando properties are free for the same reason.** A DOM element normally
has no own properties at all — everything real lives on the prototype — so
anything found there was put there by script. React's `__reactFiber$…`, Vue's
`__vue_app__` and Angular's `__ngContext__` all fall out of one generic sweep.

**Versions come from six shapes.** Reading a version means touching page objects,
so the MAIN-world script tries `.version` (React, Vue, Alpine, htmx, Next),
`.VERSION` (Backbone), `.version.full` (AngularJS), `.fn.jquery` (jQuery), the
first entry of an array (Lit's `litElementVersions`) and `.v` as a `Set`
(Svelte's `window.__svelte`). A result only counts if it looks like a version —
which is what stops SvelteKit's build id, a 13-digit timestamp sitting in a
property called `version`, being reported as a release.

### Absorbed evidence

Next.js *is* React and ships webpack or Turbopack. Reporting all three as
separate findings would be technically true and useless, so a meta-framework
absorbs what is intrinsic to it and the popup shows those traces as chips under
the card, evidence and all.

Only intrinsic relationships are folded in. React on webpack is a *choice*, not
a fact about React, so those stay two findings — and Astro keeps its islands
separate, because an Astro island can be React, Vue, Svelte or nothing at all.

### Conflicts

Two findings in the same category — two bundlers, or two rival frameworks — get
the devil icon. Libraries that legitimately live alongside anything (jQuery,
Lit, Alpine, htmx, Stimulus, Backbone, Knockout) are exempt: jQuery next to
React is a normal Tuesday, not a contradiction.

## Caveats worth knowing

- **jQuery never takes the icon.** It is on a large share of the web and is
  hardly ever the most interesting thing about a page, so anything else found
  beside it wins. Everything else sorts on the weight of its evidence, which is
  what puts Alpine ahead of the Preact-based search widget on alpinejs.dev.
- **Rspack ≤ 1.x leaves webpack-shaped traces.** Rspack ships a deliberately
  webpack-compatible runtime: 0.7 and 1.x emit `webpackChunk*` and
  `data-webpack` markers like webpack 5. The `ruid` stamp rescues 1.0+, but an
  Rspack 0.x site is reported as webpack 5 and there is no signal to do better.
  Rspack 2's ESM chunks are the opposite case: no chunk global and no
  `data-rspack`, just the exported `__rspack_esm_id`/`__rspack_esm_ids` names —
  which is what makes them worth matching on their own.
- **Alpine vendors Vue's reactivity package**, so `__v_isRef` and `__v_isReactive`
  appear in Alpine bundles. Vue is matched on `__v_isVNode` instead, which lives
  in `runtime-core` and only ships with a real Vue app.
- **A widget counts.** Algolia DocSearch is built with Preact and Builder.io
  embeds React, so sites carrying either really do have that library on the
  page. The popup says so; it does not claim the site was written in it.
- **A zero-JS Astro page rests on one marker.** With no islands and no client
  router there is no runtime to find; the `/_astro/` stylesheet link is the only
  evidence left. Change `build.assets` and the page becomes undetectable.
- **Minified Rollup and esbuild output is undetectable.** Neither adds a runtime
  to a plain ESM bundle, and minification renames esbuild's interop helpers. A
  silent result is the honest one.
- Only the first 256 KB and the last 256 KB of each script are searched. Bundler
  markers live at both ends — chunks register themselves on the first line, and
  webpack and Rspack put the runtime at the end of the entry chunk — so the
  middle is application code that costs time and yields nothing.
- Only scripts the HTML names are read: every `<script src>` and every
  `<link rel="modulepreload">`, with no cap on how many. Chunks the page pulls
  in later via `import()` are not chased. The modulepreload half is load-
  bearing, not thoroughness for its own sake — VitePress ships an almost empty
  entry `<script>` and puts the Vite runtime behind a modulepreload, so
  dropping it makes vuejs.org and vite.dev undetectable.
- The iframe used to enumerate built-in globals is created, read and removed
  synchronously at `document_idle`. On a page with a `frame-src` CSP that
  forbids it, the script falls back to prefix-matching a fixed list of names —
  less complete, never wrong.
- The page can, in principle, forge the `postMessage` that carries globals and
  DOM properties to the extension. The worst it achieves is a wrong icon; the
  script contents the background reads are unaffected.

## Development

```sh
npm test             # match the engine against real bundle output and real pages
npm run build        # assemble dist/chrome and dist/firefox
npm run validate     # check both builds are loadable
npm run icons        # re-render icons/src/* to icons/*.png
```

`test/fixtures/` holds two kinds of fixture, both real:

- **bundle fixtures** — production output of one small app (an entry module, a
  dynamic import and a CSS import) built with Vite 2 through 8, webpack 4 and 5,
  Rspack 1.x and 2.x, Turbopack, Parcel, Rollup and esbuild; plus each UI
  framework's own Vite starter template, and each site generator's own starter
  docs site, built and rendered.
- **page fixtures** — `page.json`, the exact facts the content scripts harvest,
  captured from a real page in a real browser. Each one keeps the *whole*
  harvest, analytics noise included, so a rule that fires on somebody's tag
  manager fails the test rather than shipping.

`npm test` asserts the technology, the version string, what was folded into what
and that nothing else was reported, so a rule that stops matching real output —
or starts matching something it should not — fails loudly.

### Layout

```
src/engine.js           matching engine: scoring, relations, versions (pure, runs under Node)
src/signatures/         the rule tables — bundlers, frameworks, meta-frameworks
src/content-main.js     MAIN-world script: page globals and DOM expando properties
src/content.js          isolated script: markup, attributes, inline scripts, script URLs
src/background.js       fetches scripts, matches, swaps the icon
src/popup.*             the dialog
tools/                  build, validate, icon rendering, PNG resizing
test/run.mjs            engine tests against committed bundle output and page captures
```

The Firefox add-on id in `manifest.firefox.json` is
`web-stack-detector@swwind`. It is an identity, not a name: changing it again
after publishing would make Firefox treat this as a different add-on and lose
every existing install.

### CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the signature tests, builds both targets and
checks they are loadable. That is the whole of it.

### Adding a technology

1. Look at something real and read what it leaves behind. Guessed patterns are
   worse than no patterns.
2. Add an entry to the right file in `src/signatures/`, with `seen:` noting what
   you checked it against. Set `category`, and add a relation at the bottom of
   the file if another finding should be absorbed into it.
3. Put the project's own logo in as `icons/src/<id>.svg` (or `.png` if that is
   all they publish) and run `npm run icons`, which writes `icons/<id>.png` at
   128 px. That one file is what the repo keeps; `npm run build` derives the
   toolbar's 48, 32 and 16 from it. A technology with no source file falls back to a lettermark on its
   own `color` so the toolbar never shows the *wrong* logo, but that is a
   placeholder, not a finished icon.
4. Add a fixture under `test/fixtures/<id>/` — a build, a `page.json` capture, or
   both — and a case in `test/run.mjs`.

Nothing else needs touching: the icon list, the popup's category groups and the
build validator all read the signature registry.

## License

MIT, for the code — see [LICENSE](LICENSE). The icons are a separate matter;
see the credits below.

## Icon credits

Most icons are the projects' own artwork:

Every icon is the project's own artwork.

| Icon | Source |
| --- | --- |
| vite, webpack, parcel, rollup, esbuild, react, vue, angular, svelte, next, nuxt, gatsby, ember, qwik, remix | [material-icon-theme](https://github.com/material-extensions/vscode-material-icon-theme) (MIT) |
| solid, lit, preact, docusaurus, vitepress, stimulus | the project's own published SVG — solidjs.com, lit.dev (the `flame` symbol out of its full lockup), the preactjs.com branding assets, docusaurus.io, vitepress.dev, stimulus.hotwired.dev |
| jquery, alpine, htmx, angularjs, backbone | [devicon](https://github.com/devicons/devicon) (MIT) — those five publish a wide wordmark as their own asset, and devicon carries the square symbol from the same logo |
| rspack | the site favicon, `https://assets.rspack.rs/rspack/favicon-128x128.png` |
| turbopack | the Turbo mark from the [vercel/turborepo](https://github.com/vercel/turborepo) README |
| astro | the mark from `https://astro.build/favicon.svg` |
| knockout | the [Knockout organisation](https://github.com/knockout) avatar on GitHub — the same script K as their favicon, at 460 px instead of 16 |
| sveltekit | the Svelte mark, which is SvelteKit's own branding too — the toolbar cannot tell the two apart, the popup can |

Four are recoloured, shape untouched, because their published colour disappears
against a toolbar: `astro` (dark on dark), `next` and `remix` (material-icon-theme
ships them near-white, which vanishes on a light toolbar), and `stimulus` (whose
SVG sets no fill at all, so it renders black). Nothing else is altered, and
nothing is drawn by hand.

Only the devil (conflict state) and the unknown-state cube are invented, since
neither corresponds to a real project.

Rspack and Turbopack publish their marks as raster only, so `icons/src/` holds
PNGs for those two and `npm run icons` resamples them; the rest are SVG.

These files are the projects' trademarks, whatever the licence on the repository
they were fetched from. Fine for personal use; worth checking before publishing
to the Chrome Web Store or AMO.
